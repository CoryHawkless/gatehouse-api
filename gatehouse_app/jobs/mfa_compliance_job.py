"""MFA Compliance Scheduled Job.

This module implements the scheduled job for processing MFA compliance transitions,
sending notifications to users approaching deadlines, and handling edge cases.

The job is designed to be run periodically (e.g., via cron) to:
1. Transition users from PAST_DUE to SUSPENDED status
2. Send deadline reminder notifications to users in grace period
3. Update notification tracking metadata

Usage:
    python manage.py run_mfa_compliance_job

Or call directly:
    from gatehouse_app.jobs.mfa_compliance_job import process_mfa_compliance
    process_mfa_compliance()
